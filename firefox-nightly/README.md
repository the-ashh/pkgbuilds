# firefox nightly

this is my custom, scuffed, firefox nightly pkgbuild. 

in regards to the update script, you might have to change it around a bit, as i do have my aur things in `~/aur`, so keep that in mind if you end up using that

i use that script in a crontab, hence the pkexec instad of sudo. don't wanna have to put my password in my crontab, that would be no bueno
